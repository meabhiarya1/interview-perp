// How it works:

// last: Tracks the last time the function was called.
// On each event trigger (onKeyUp):
// If the time since the last call is less than delay (1500ms here), the function is ignored.
// If the time since the last call is more than delay, the function executes and updates last.


// betterFunction is a throttled version of getData with a delay of 1500ms.
// It ensures that getData will execute at most once every 1.5 seconds, even if multiple key presses occur.


// Difference Between Throttling & Debouncing:

// Feature	                 Throttling	                             Debouncing
// Execution Frequency	     Limits execution to fixed intervals	   Executes after inactivity
// Use Case	                 Scroll, resize, mouse events	           Search input, form validation
// Control Mechanism	       Executes every delay ms	               Waits delay ms after last event


// âœ… Summary:
// Throttling: Limits function execution to once every 1500ms.
// Debouncing: Waits until the user stops typing for a delay duration before executing.
